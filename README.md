# B-Tech_AFM_Project
# Flight Descent Phase Modeling Project
This repository contains the modeling work for the descent phase of an aircraft using Aircraft Flight Mechanics (AFM) principles. The project simulates key parameters like glide path, descent rate, and drag forces during controlled descent.
​
# Project Overview
This project models the non-powered descent trajectory of a fixed-wing aircraft. Focuses on 3-DOF equations of motion, aerodynamic coefficients, and stability analysis for the descent regime.

# Key Features
- MATLAB implementation of descent dynamics
- Studies on Min Sink Rate and Max Range
- Validation against standard glide performance equations
- Plots for velocity profiles, altitude vs. time, and flight path angle
